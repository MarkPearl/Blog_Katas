#### The Context ####
I have been attending Code Retreats for 3 years. Each time I have been I have learn't something new. Following each session at a retreat there is a brief retrospective circle. Inevitably sometime during one of the retrospectives the question is asked - "Who tackled the problem from the bottom up versus the top down?"

Each time the question is asked there is a mix of responses with advocates for both approaches. In general there have been more bottom uppers than top downers although for a while now I have been in the minority and encouraged a top down approach. Today I would like to explore the concept further.
